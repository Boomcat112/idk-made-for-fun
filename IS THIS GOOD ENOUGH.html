-No.1: Talk with people, examples: 
<br>1.Gam3_boi: he's the mastermind of that place!
<br>
<br>2.Aiz aka the snowman he makes the rules and he like memes!
<br>
<br>3.AND THE BEAR HUNTER! ALSO KNOWN AS lab2018dor hes a nice person that has kind of a intriguing lore (storytime), he's a cool dude in general!
<br>
<br>4.Wisperflare: he's funny, he likes the awesome sunsets lab2013rador experiences, i bet he likes pizza and i also think he might be muslim, since he sent a pic of his arabic writing (very beautiful looking lettere even tho idk what those doodles mean) he's everyone's friend :)
